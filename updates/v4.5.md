## Highlights
* **UTM Remote server for macOS** On macOS 13+, you can enable UTM Server from the new option on the home screen or from Window -> UTM Server. Once enabled, you can stream QEMU backend VMs to supported clients. The preferences page includes additional options including auto-starting the server and allowing external connections so it can be used outside of the local network. New documentation pages will be added in the future.
* **UTM Remote client for iOS and visionOS** When UTM Server is enabled on macOS, you can connect to it with the new UTM Remote client which uses the same frontend as UTM for iOS/visionOS but without any of the QEMU backend. TestFlight will be available as soon as it is approved and the plans are to release it as a free app in the App Store.

## Notes
* **macOS**{: .label .label-green } The automation URI scheme has been removed due to potential security issues if the user clicks a malicious link that sends an input to the VM. Most of the URI scheme functionality has moved to [the scripting interface]({% link scripting/reference.html %}).
